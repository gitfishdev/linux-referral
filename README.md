# Referral rewards

This repo contains payout data for GitFish referral rewards.

Referrers are eligible to earn 25% of protocol fees generated by their referrals. 

Only referrers that have earned at least 0.001 SOL in rewards will be paid in each distribution event. We will send out accumulated rewards to users once their total balance crosses above the limit.

## Finding your rewards balance

To find your rewards balance, search for your wallet address in one of the json files.

Each entry shows the referrer, reward amount, itemized referrals and payout tx hash:

```json
{
  "referrer": "GQoo9iMGYAzAZnXtgm5oE28f5GvaXZ1MdhtcdrhCaAzM",
  "rewardAmount": 0.715,
  "referred": [
    {
      "wallet": "4n2jvyYqVFxBaZyCNfBurtBBLjbpyDucTemoL5qb3RdB",
      "bidAmount": "286"
    }
  ],
  "tx": "VHimWj36o4jUGzTyr8WwjRc1CHtdS6sC9aiXNm25AkPJJbmeNrVwZY1tnE4iHeWf2GRK4aB5Hwj8t7YBrvnx4DM"
}
```

You can confirm the payout by searching for the tx hash in a block explorer like [Solscan](https://solscan.io/).
