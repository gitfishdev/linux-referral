# Referral rewards

This repo contains payout data for GitFish referral rewards.

Referrers are eligible to earn 25% of protocol fees generated by their referrals. 

Only referrers that have earned at least 0.001 SOL in rewards will be paid in each distribution event. We will send out accumulated rewards to users once their total balance crosses above the limit.
